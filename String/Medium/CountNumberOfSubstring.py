     * !Count substrings with k distinct characters
     * Given a string s consisting of lowercase characters and an integer k,
     * the task is to count all possible substrings (not necessarily distinct) that have exactly k distinct characters.
     *
     * @param Examples:
     * Input: s = "abc", k = 2
     * Output: 2
     * Explanation: Possible substrings are ["ab", "bc"]
     *
     * Input: s = "aba", k = 2
     * Output: 3
     * Explanation: Possible substrings are ["ab", "ba", "aba"]
     *
     * Input: s = "aa", k = 1
     * Output: 3
     * Explanation: Possible substrings are ["a", "a", "aa"]
     *
     * !Approach1: Checking All Substring(Time complexity: O(n^2), Space complexity: O(1))
     * !Approach2: Sliding Window(Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(1))
     *
     * Step1: Use a sliding window with an array of size 26 to track character frequencies.
     * Step2: Expand the window to the right, adding characters.
     * Step3: Shrink the window from the left when distinct characters exceed k.
     * Step4: Count all valid substrings within the window.
     * Step5: Subtract substrings with k-1 distinct characters from k distinct characters.
     *
     * @param Formula: countExactK = countAtMostK âˆ’ countAtMostKMinus1
