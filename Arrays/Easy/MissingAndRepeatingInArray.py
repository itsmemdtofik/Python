 * !Missing and repeating in an array.
 * Given an unsorted array of size n. Array elements are in the range of 1 to n.
 * One number from set {1, 2, â€¦n} is missing and one number occurs twice in the
 * array. Find these two numbers.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input: arr[] = {3, 1, 3}
 * Output: Missing = 2, Repeating = 3
 * Explanation: In the array, 2 is missing and 3 occurs twice
 *
 *
 * Input: arr[] = {4, 3, 6, 2, 1, 1}
 * Output: Missing = 5, Repeating = 1
