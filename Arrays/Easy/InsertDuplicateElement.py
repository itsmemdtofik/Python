 * !Insert duplicate of K adjacent to it for its every occurrences in array.
 *
 * Given an array arr consisting of N integers and an integer K, the task is to
 * insert an adjacent K for every occurrence of it in the original sequence and
 * then truncate the array to the original length using an O(1) auxiliary space.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input: arr[] = {1, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5, 0}, K = 0
 * Output: {1, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 4}
 * Explanation:
 * The given array {1, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5, 0} is modified to {1, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 4]
 * after insertion of two 0â€™s and truncation of extra elements.
 *
 *
 * Input: arr[] = {7, 5, 8}, K = 8
 * Output: {7, 5, 8}
 * Explanation:
 * After inserting an adjacent 8 into the array, it got truncated to restore the
 * original size of the array.
 * !Approach: Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(n)
 * Step1: First we counted all the K in arr
 * Step2: And we created a new arr ith length of newArr = [arr.length + count] and stored all items into it and truncated it.
 * Step3: Return new array
