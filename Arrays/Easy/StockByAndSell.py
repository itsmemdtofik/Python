# Stock Buy and Sell â€“ Max one Transaction Allowed
# **************************

# Given an array prices[] of length N, representing the prices of the stocks on different days, 
# the task is to find the maximum profit possible by buying and selling the stocks on different days 
# when at most one transaction is allowed. 
# Here one transaction means 1 buy + 1 Sell.

# Note: Stock must be bought before being sold.

# Examples:

# Input: prices[] = [7, 10, 1, 3, 6, 9, 2]
# Output: 8
# Explanation: Buy for price 1 and sell for price 9.

# Input: prices[] = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: Since the array is sorted in decreasing order, 0 profit can be made 
# without making any transaction.

# Input: prices[] = [1, 3, 6, 9, 11]
# Output: 10
# Explanation: Since the array is sorted in increasing order, we can make 
# maximum profit by buying at price[0] and selling at price[n-1].
