# ! Missing and Repeating in an array
# 
# Given an unsorted array of size n. Array elements are in the range of 1 to n.
# One number from set {1, 2, â€¦n} is missing and one number occurs twice in the array.
# Find these two numbers.
#
# Examples:
# Input: arr = [3, 1, 3]
# Output: Missing = 2, Repeating = 3
#
# Input: arr = [4, 3, 6, 2, 1, 1]
# Output: Missing = 5, Repeating = 1
