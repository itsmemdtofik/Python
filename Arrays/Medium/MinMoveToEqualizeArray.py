     * <pre>
     * !Minimum number of increment-other operations to make all array elements equal.
     * We are given an array consisting of n elements.
     * At each operation we can select any one element and increase rest of n-1 elements by 1.
     * We have to make all elements equal performing such operation as many times you wish.
     * Find the minimum number of operations needed for this.
     *
     * @param Examples:
     * Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3]
     * Output: 3
     * Explanation:
     * Operation 1 : Increase all except 3rd, we get 2, 3, 3
     * Operation 2 : Increase all except 3rd, we get 3, 4, 3
     * Operation 3 : Increase all except 2nd, we get 4, 4, 4
     *
     * Input: arr[] = [4, 3, 4]
     * Output: 2
     * Explanation:
     * Operation 1 : Increase all except 3rd, we get 5, 4, 4
     * Operation 2 : Increase all except 1st, we get 5, 5, 5
     *
     * !Approach: Using Sorting â€“ O(n^2log n) Time and O(1) Space
     * Increments all elements except the maximum one in each step until all elements become equal..
     * The array is modified in-place, and no extra space is used other than the input array.
