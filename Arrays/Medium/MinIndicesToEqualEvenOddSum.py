     * !Ways to make sum of odd and even indexed elements equal by removing an array element
     * Given an array, arr[] of size n, the task is to find the count of array indices
     * such that removing an element from these indices makes the sum of even-indexed
     * and odd-indexed array elements equal.
     *
     * @param Examples:
     * Input: arr[] = [ 2, 1, 6, 4 ]
     * Output: 1
     * Explanation: Removing arr[1] from the array modifies arr[] to [ 2, 6, 4 ] such that, arr[0] + arr[2] = arr[1].
     * Therefore, the required output is 1.
     *
     * Input: arr[] = [ 1, 1, 1 ]
     * Output: 3
     * Explanation: Removing arr[0] from the given array modifies arr[] to [ 1, 1 ] such that arr[1] = arr[2]
     * Removing arr[1] from the given array modifies arr[] to [ 1, 1 ] such that arr[0] = arr[2]
     * Removing arr[2] from the given array modifies arr[] to [ 1, 1 ] such that arr[0] = arr[1]
     * Therefore, the required output is 3.
     *
     * !Approach: Using Nested Loop â€“ O(n^2) Time and O(1) Space
     * The simplest approach to solve this problem is to traverse the array and for each array element,
     * check if removing the element from the array makes the sum of even-indexed and odd-indexed array elements equal or not.
     * If found to be true, then increment the count. Finally, print the count.
