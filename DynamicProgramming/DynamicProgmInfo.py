"""
 * <pre>
 * !Dynamic Programming Details
 * Dynamic Programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down
 * into simpler subproblems and storing the results of those subproblems to avoid redundant computation.
 *
 * @param Two key ideas:
 * Overlapping subproblems
 * Optimal substructure
 *
 * !Common Approaches:
 * Top-Down (Memoization) – Recursion + caching results.
 * Bottom-Up (Tabulation) – Iterative, building up the solution.
 *
 * !Classic Problems (we’ll go one by one)
 * Fibonacci Numbers – Intro to DP
 * Climbing Stairs – Count paths with DP
 * 0/1 Knapsack – Optimization problem
 * Longest Common Subsequence
 * Coin Change
 * Subset Sum / Partition Problem
 * DP on Trees / Grids / Strings
 * Advanced: Bitmask DP, DP with State Compression
 * </pre>
