     * !0/1 Knapsack Problems
     * You are given N items. Each item has:
     * A weight w[i]
     * A value v[i]
     * You also have a knapsack with a maximum capacity W.
     * You need to choose a subset of items such that:
     * The total weight of selected items does not exceed W
     * The total value is maximized
     * You can either take an item or not (0/1 Knapsack â€” each item is included at most once)
     *
     * @param Examples:
     * Weights: [1, 3, 4, 5]
     * Values:  [1, 4, 5, 7]
     * Capacity(W): 7
     * !Approach: Bottom-Up(Tabulation) : Only Iterative no recursive call + storage (matrix table)
     * Step1: Create a matrix dp[][]
     * Step2: Initialize it to first rows and first column as zero
     * Step3: Main Logic
     * Step4: Return last rows and column matrix
     *

    | **Time Complexity**  | `O(n * W)`                                       |
    | **Space Complexity** | `O(n * W)` for DP table + `O(n)` recursion stack |
