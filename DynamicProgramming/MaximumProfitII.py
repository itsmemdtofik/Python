     * <pre>
     * !0/1 Knapsack Problems
     * You are given N items. Each item has:
     * A weight w[i]
     * A value v[i]
     * You also have a knapsack with a maximum capacity W.
     * You need to choose a subset of items such that:
     * The total weight of selected items does not exceed W
     * The total value is maximized
     * You can either take an item or not (0/1 Knapsack â€” each item is included at most once)
     *
     * @param Examples:
     * Weights: [1, 3, 4, 5]
     * Values:  [1, 4, 5, 7]
     * Capacity(W): 7
     * !Approach: Top-Down(Recursive + memoization) ==> Recursive + storage
     *
