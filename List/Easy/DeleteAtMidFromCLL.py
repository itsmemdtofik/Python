Deletion from a Circular Linked List

In this article, we will learn how to delete a node from a circular linked list.
In a circular linked list, the last node connects back to the first node, creating a loop.

There are three main ways to delete a node from circular linked list:

1. Deletion at the beginning
2. Deletion at specific position
3. Deletion at the end
Now, letâ€™s look at the methods and steps for these three deletion operations.

Deletion from a Circular Linked List:
Deletion involves removing a node from the linked list.
The main difference is that we need to ensure the list remains circular after the deletion.
We can delete a node in a circular linked list in three ways:
"""

from Node import SingleLinkedList as Node


def deleteAtSpecificPosition(last: Node, key: int):
    if last is None:
        print(f"List is empty, nothing to delete.")
        return

    currentNode = last.next
    previousNode = last

    # If the node to be deleted is the only node in the list
    if currentNode == last and currentNode.data == key:
        last = None
        return last

    # If the node to delete is the first node
    if currentNode.data == key:
        last.next = currentNode.next
        return last

    # Traverse the list to find the node to be deleted
    while currentNode != last and currentNode.data != key:
        previousNode = currentNode
        currentNode = currentNode.next

    # If the node to be deleted is found
    if currentNode.data == key:
        previousNode.next = currentNode.next
        if currentNode == last:
            last = previousNode
        else:
            print(f"Node with data {key} not found")
    return last


def print_list(last):
    if last is None:
        return

    head = last.next
    while True:
        print(head.data, end=" -> ")
        head = head.next
        if head == last.next:
            break
    print("NULL")


first = Node(2)
first.next = Node(3)
first.next.next = Node(4)

last = first.next.next
last.next = first

print("Original list: ", end="")
print_list(last)

key = 3
last = deleteAtSpecificPosition(last, key)

print(f"List after deleting node {key}: ", end="")
print_list(last)
