     * !Merges two linked lists at alternate positions.
     * Given two singly linked lists, The task is to insert nodes of the second list
     * into the first list at alternate positions of the first list and leave the
     * remaining nodes of the second list if it is longer.
     *
     * @param Example:
     * Input: head1: 1->2->3 , head2: 4->5->6->7->8
     * Output: head1: 1->4->2->5->3->6 , head2: 7->8
     *
     * !Approach: Using Iterative Method â€“ O(n) Time and O(1) Space
     * The idea is to start traversing from the beginning of both lists.
     * For each step, take a node from the second list and insert it after a node from the first list.
     * This process continues until we reach the end of one or both lists.
     * If the second list is longer, remaining nodes will be kept as it is second list.
     * </pre>
